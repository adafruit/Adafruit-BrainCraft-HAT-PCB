### Description

The idea behind the BrainCraft HAT is that you’d be able to “craft brains” for Machine Learning on the EDGE, with Microcontrollers & Microcomputers. On ASK AN ENGINEER, our founder & engineer chatted with Pete Warden, the technical lead of the mobile, embedded TensorFlow Group on Google’s Brain team about what would be ideal for a board like this.

And here’s what we designed! The BrainCraft HAT has a 240×240 TFT IPS display for inference output, slots for camera connector cable for imaging projects, a 5 way joystick and button for UI input, left and right microphones, stereo headphone out, stereo 1 W speaker out, three RGB DotStar LEDs, two 3 pin STEMMA connectors on PWM pins so they can drive NeoPixels or servos, and Grove/STEMMA/Qwiic I2C port. This will let people build a wide range of audio/video AI projects while also allowing easy plug-in of sensors and robotics!

A controllable mini fan attaches to the bottom, and can be used to keep your Pi cool while doing intense AI inference calculations. **Most importantly, there’s an On/Off switch that will completely disable the audio codec, so that when it's off there’s no way it's listening to you.**

**Features:**
 * **1.54" IPS TFT** display with 240x240 resolution that can show text or video
 * **Stereo speaker ports for audio playback** - either text-to-speech, alerts or for creating a voice assistant.
 * **Stereo headphone out** for audio playback through a stereo system, headphones, or powered speakers.
 * **Stereo microphone input** - perfect for making your very own smart home assistants
 * **Two 3-pin JST STEMMA connectors** that can be used to [connect more buttons](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4431), [a relay](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4409), or [even some NeoPixels!](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3919)
 * **[STEMMA QT plug-and-play I2C port](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt)**, can be used with [any of our 50+ I2C STEMMA QT boards](https://www.adafruit.com/category/620), or can be used to [connect to Grove I2C devices with an adapter cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4528).
 * **5-Way Joystick + Button** for user interface and control.
 * **Three RGB DotStar LEDs** for colorful LED feedback.

The STEMMA QT port means you can attach heat image sensors like the [Panasonic Grid-EYE](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3538) or [MLX90640](https://www.adafruit.com/?q=mlx90640&sort=BestMatch). Heat-Sensitive cameras can be used as a person detector, even in the dark! An external accelerometer can be attached for gesture or vibration sensing such as machinery/industrial predictive maintenance projects
